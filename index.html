<h2 style>About me</h2>
<p style = "font-size: 20px;">I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Nottingham studying Computer Science, starting in 2016. I spend most of my free-time programming and working on large projects. As a programmer, I prioritise performance and despise verbosity. As an individual, I strongly enjoy political debate, especially among those who I disagree with.<br><br> My pleasure comes from building a high-quality product whilst remaining minimalistic. My ultimate goal is to work freelance as an occupation whilst developing my own projects in my free-time; I love to be busy. I would like to gain more experience in scripting languages as a companion to my normally heavy-duty C++ programs, such as Lua, AngelScript or perhaps something closer to true logic, such as a dialect of Lisp.</p>
